# **Determination of Helical Spring Constant ($k$) with Least Squares Method**

This project aims to determine the spring constant ($k$) using two different physical approaches:
1.  **Static Method:** Based on Hooke's Law.
2.  **Dynamic Method:** Based on Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) oscillations.

The goal is to transform a traditional physics experiment into a reproducible Python data pipeline using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. A key feature of this project is the **manual implementation of Linear Regression (Least Squares Method)**, avoiding "black-box" libraries (like scikit-learn) to demonstrate algorithmic proficiency.
